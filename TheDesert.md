# THE DESERT

##### by Greg S. Cassel, circa 1991
#

*Outside of the laughing lights of the town*

*A man in the weirdness wildly bends down*

*A beast with the glint of glory in eye*

*Tortured and spurned yet unwilling to die*

*Cast into the night with only a knife*

*Unfit to protect his fragile young life...*

My name is Nathan Abel.  I will soon die.  There is no escape from that grim Shadow 
lurking over me, hungry and impatient.

How long have I been on this mortal quest?  Days, weeks?  No, years it has been.  
Years wasted stumbling about a bleak desert landscape, hoping to chance upon my 
destination.  And whichever way I wander, death looms ever nearer, chasing me across 
this ugly plain.

Already the vigor has abandoned my softening legs,  and I fear they'll soon collapse.  
My cracked lips bleed for want of water, scraping a cruelly bloated tongue.  My 
trembling flesh frames a stomach consumed from within by restless seething compounds.  
Bloody eyes bulge near the bursting point, begging release from the merciless 
sand-blasting wind.  Having led me to this desert tomb, those optic orbs now threaten to 
abandon me here.  
     
So this is death.  It's not as spectacular as I would have wished, nor as swift.  

It comes on slowly -- first my heart skips a beat, then a massive cramp racks the 
length of my back.  My parched mouth is slimed by a surge of thick liquid from my 
throat.  As the crimson spills through my tattered lips, I fall to a knee, omnipresent sand 
driving into the tender joint.  My fading vision reveals the dark Shadow swallowing the 
sky above.  I fight it with all my will.

It laughs and feeds.

Unresponsive sinew collapses and I yield clumsily to gravity.  The Shadow 
approaches chuckling and darkness engulfs me.

AM I DEAD?  I wonder an eternity later, shocked that I can think.  I AM STILL I!... 
aren't I?

My eyes snap open reflexively, centering on a shadowy wraith-like form hovering 
above.  I lie on the treacherous brink of a towering promontory.  Rising to my feet,  I see 
bottomless waters beckon far below.

I realize with a slightly numb feeling of horror that I have been here before...

I have done this before...

And I will do it again.  I must do it again.

Yet I cannot clearly see what will happen, until it does.  I only know that as each 
moment of the dream unfolds, I recognize it with stale revulsion, and I am resigned to act 
as I have before -- because I want to live, whatever the cost.

The Shadow finally speaks as I stare at the shapeless waters below, wondering what 
they conceal.  "'Tis the unknown that calls to you, Abel.  The desert lies behind;  you 
have seen its perils," whispers the Shadow.

"The world is hard," I agree, reflecting on the vast injustices of a short turbulent life.  
"What promise does that sea offer?"  I always ask the same damned question.

"The unknown is the end of all want.  Those with the courage to face it no longer 
suffer the hungers you do, Abel.  Do you not yearn to cast off the shackles of this barren 
life and feast on the riches beyond?"

The urgent words massage my mind and prostrate my body.  I fight for the strength to 
speak words I hate to say.  "You ask me to die," I murmur. 

"Death wears many faces," the Shadow replies, "and you have seen many."  I attempt 
to block painful memories.  "Is mine a face of death, Abel?" the Shadow challenges.  My 
eyes are locked on its nothingness.

"I don't know," I reply.  "I can't say that I've seen you kill anyone.  In fact, many of 
those I've seen have died at each others' hands, fighting over scraps they stole from 
others."  I think of the ruthless riders, and want to run from the memories.  Then I 
remember the others... The ones whose shriveled bodies I'd found on the open plains, 
slain by their own hands, unwilling to live in the desert.  Their faces had been stained 
with a sickly shade of peace and their eyes had been empty... A void...

A shadowy void...

I shriek in wild horror as I imagine myself drowning in the sea below.  I picture the 
Shadow feasting on my soul, leaving my empty body to wash up on some desert shore.  I 
picture some lost fool staring at my empty foolish face.  That fool would probably jump 
too.

But I will not-- not now. 

The Shadow releases me from its icy embrace, disappointed as I turn away from the 
cliff.

"Do you not see, Abel?" it calls.  "Your strength is your weakness.  One can not die if 
one does not live..."

"How dare you call me weak?" I scorn.  "You who feed off my pain and yet can not 
force me to do the weak and cowardly thing!  I will not die!"  I proclaim, with a sudden 
resolve that transforms my fears into hate.  And I turn on the Shadow in hatred.

As I attack it, I realize I've made a mistake.  I've given it an opening.  The Shadow 
leaps into my mind with the relish of a hungry beast.  It begins to kill me, piece by piece.

I remember the first thing I had ever enjoyed doing.  I had been living with a rider, 
and I remember the first time I'd been given control over his favorite camel.  I still feel 
the power, the newfound freedom, coursing through my veins.  Often I have clung to this 
memory when the world has gone out of control.

The Shadow kills the memory.

The Shadow kills the memory and I cling to its bloody corpse, wishing for that feeling 
again, as the Shadow searches for fresh meat.

I remember a beautiful woman who had ridden camels with my tribe.  I remember the 
sweet fantasies I had dreamed when I was young enough to believe in love.

The Shadow kills the memory.

The Shadow kills the memory and I cling to its bloody corpse, wishing for those 
dreams again, as the Shadow searches for fresh meat.  It draws forth another part of me.

Over and over, the Shadow bites beneath my skull and kills all those things I've held 
dear amidst the pain I've felt-- all those things I've never wanted to lose; all those things 
that define me.  And as I'm trickling into a void, I realize that I've been here before-- but 
how can that be?

How had I survived, and given myself the chance to live this lingering hell again?

As I wonder, the Shadow draws forth another memory-- one it should have left alone.
A memory of me gathering my remains in an anger strong enough to fight once more... a 
memory of me doing what I must to save my soul...  And I do it.  I throw the Shadow off 
the cliff.  As it shrieks, the dream ends.  

I must move on.  Every muscle screams as I rise from the sand, but I ignore the 
searing pain.  I will live with it, until I find another way to live.

Ages pass as I trudge onward through the endless desert.  If there is anything else to 
the world, my people have long since forgotten it.  And I have forsaken them on my quest 
for a better life.  I'm ready to try almost anything.

Finally, I see a light in the distance.  As I approach it I see it is a shining edifice-- one I 
recognize from stories.  Often travelers have spoken of the temple, wherein dwells 
eternal life and peace.  Sounds pretty good right now.  Invigorated at the thought of 
salvation, I press onward to the mighty doors of the sanctuary.  They swing in 
effortlessly; I sense it's easier to enter than to leave.

As I pass down the long entrance hall, I feel that the weight of the world has magically 
been lifted from my back.  A cool gentle breeze soothes me and lifts away the sand that 
has tormented me.  An ornate fountain rises before me and I quench my thirst for the first 
time I can remember.  As I hold my wet face, sobbing with relief, I feel hope rising 
through my renewed body.  I have seen the worst the desert can bring to me, and I've 
reached this temple.  Perhaps here I will learn why it is necessary for people to suffer in 
the desert.

Perhaps it is not necessary at all.

A monk of the temple walks up behind me.  I turn to look at him and he bows politely.  
My still-bleary eyes cannot discern his features.  "Welcome to our sanctuary, traveler.  
We salute you for your brave journey and we offer all we have for your inspection.  
Perhaps you are worthy to join us here?"  he asks.

"Worthy?" I question with sudden anxiety.  I feel like I've already been thoroughly 
tested.  I've survived.

The monk smiles knowingly.  "The holy man is more than a survivor, child.  He is a 
man prepared to accept judgement for all actions great and small."  The monk leans 
forward, his bright eyes intense on my face.  "Are you ready to stand before God and bare 
your soul to the light?  Will you stare unflinchingly at what you have done, and proclaim 
without regret:  "This is I?"

The monk leans even nearer.  "Will you stare into the all-knowing eyes of God and 
say, "I have done no wrong.  Put me where I belong?"

The words burn into my soul with a cleansing fire.   Self-doubt flees and the truth 
becomes clear:  It is time for judgement.

I don't know if I'm ready to face this man's god.  I don't know if I care what he thinks; I 
don't even know if he's real.  But I know I must face myself.  I must look at what I've 
done, and where I've been-- and then I must look at where I am, and ask myself:

Do I belong here?

If not, I may have to jump.

So I answer all the monk's questions-- and I listen to the answers as carefully as does 
he.

"Tell me who you are," intones the religious man.  I look inside and find an answer.

"I had no name I can recall before I entered the desert.  I remember looking at these 
wastelands from beyond, amazed at the harshness and discord.  I remember my horror 
when I saw that men lived in such a place.

"Some were isolated from the elements by protective apparel and saved the task of 
walking by ignorant camels.  These camel-riders seemed blissful most of the time.  Many 
of them laughed at the miserable souls who faced the harsh desert clime unprotected and 
on foot.  Those ones called themselves the walkers.

"I decided to enter the desert."

"Why?" asks the monk, seemingly confused.

"The desert didn't make sense to me," I reply.  Why did people live in such a place, 
fighting each other for the basics of a meager existence?  I believed everything had a 
purpose-- and to truly understand the desert's purpose, I would have to experience that 
world firsthand.  So I attempted to enter the desert world.  But my journey was not direct.

"I became disoriented and found myself first in a world entirely different from the one 
I had seen!  A world that was no desert at all, but a teeming jungle of light and life and 
ideas!  Creatures leaped about and intermingled in reckless ways I had never seen!

"Even now I can't remember much of where I'd come from-- but I know that it was a 
much different, a much more secure environment than the jungle.  I had known what my 
role was in the previous world; I had known who I was and how I was to relate to my 
surroundings.

"The jungle was different.  I didn't have a role to play, because there was no coherent 
structure to the jungle world.  It seemed to me that all the denizens had been dropped 
there and told to do whatever they wanted!  I had not been prepared for such an 
experience.

"I wanted to establish some order in this environment; I wanted to cooperate with my 
fellows in a mutually beneficial manner.  I asked the jungle-folk what I might do to 
please them, and they told me.

"Whatever they said was the most frightening thing I could imagine.  It scared me so 
much that I still refuse to remember it!  But I remember what I did-- I ran.

"I ran through the jungle, away from all the beasts that seemed to threaten me, away 
from all the shadows.  I ran and ran until I couldn't remember why I was running.  When I 
finally thought I was safe, and could run no more, I fell to the sand, exhausted."

The monk ignores my dramatic pause.  "I was in the desert."

"It was cold, dark, and dry... so very dry.  I imagined I could feel the moisture being 
sucked out of my body by the greedy air.  But then I realized that the air held no interest 
in me or my fluids.  In fact, the desert had no desire to interact with me in any way.  It 
seemed totally inert.

"I couldn't remember my past.  I had the feeling that I had been somewhere else, 
somewhere very different, but I knew that the desert was my new home.  I knew that I 
was safe within it; my enemies could not follow me into the desert.  They couldn't 
survive in it.

"And then, I realized in panic that I couldn't survive either!   I had gone too far-- 
farther than necessary; farther than the needs of a man would travel...  I couldn't even 
breathe!

"My starving lungs cried as a neglected child; they told me 'Go back!  Go back 
whence you came, where a man might live!'   But somehow I knew that I must remain in 
the desert.  As I fell over, dying-- as I saw myself being sucked into a dark shapeless 
void-- I cried out 'Help me! I don't want to die!' and I passed out.

"When I woke up, I knew that I had been saved.  I was lying in a beautiful tent under 
the care of a camel-riding couple.  They asked me what my name was, and I had none.   
So they called me Nathan.   And it was good to have a name."

The monk seems thoughtful.  "So you became a rider, then."

"Yes, I lived their life for years."

"Why have you come to us," the monk asks, "naked and on foot?"

"The riders are a cold people," I explain.  "They hoard  the desert's few treasures in 
their guarded valleys, where the air is thick and waters pool after the sporadic rains.  And 
they foresake their less-able people, the ones who can't survive in their merciless society.  
These misfits become walkers, wandering among the higher dunes until they die from 
hunger or thirst.  As a camel-riding fortunate, I often spied on them in grisly fascination.  
Eventually I became sorrowful; I demanded to know why the riders allowed the walkers 
to suffer so.

"The riders told me that the desert is a hard place where the unfit must be left to suffer 
or die on their own.  The riders showed no pity for the walkers," I say.

"Yes.  In fact, most riders hate the walkers," adds the monk.  "And you did not?"

I am surprised.  "How could I hate those poor people?  I saw their misery, and yes, 
hate stirred within-- hate for the riders, who sat in their colorful tents sucking fruits and 
acting as if the walkers didn't exist.  Did they think they were special?   Did they think 
they had some special right to live well, and that the walkers did not??" 

"The riders are indeed special," replies the monk with a sad smile.  "But I guess you 
didn't like their kind of special, Nathan."

"I left them," I answer.  "I looked them in the eye and said, 'I shall walk the desert with 
open eyes and bare skin.  I shall see what this world offers its poor.'  The riders laughed 
at me.  They said, 'You will die, fool.  You will die as you would have before we saved 
you.'  They turned away and said, 'We will not mourn you, for you are no longer of us.'"

"So they deal with their losses," the monk observes.

"Yes," I agree, "and I wonder why they even saved me to begin with."

"Perhaps to continue their way of life," the monk ventures.  "As you know, the riders 
are a sterile people.  Their ranks would dwindle and disappear were it not for those like 
you-- runners.   Runners who come from the edge of the world."

I am startled.  "Do you know of a place beyond the edge of the desert?" I ask.  "Do you 
know of the jungle?"

The monk smiles.   "I know of a place beyond the desert, young man," he replies, 
"although I've never met one such as you, who claims to recall his prior circumstances.  
But we've all been elsewhere... And we've all run."

I listen, breathless, until I realize the monk has finished speaking.  I grope about my 
mind to find the loose threads of the tale I spin.

"So I forsook the riders," I continue, "casting off my belongings and parting with my 
faithful camel.  I ventured into the deeper dunes and became a walker.  I wanted to see if 
I could live that way.  I wanted to see if there was any good reason for anyone to live that 
way.  And if I couldn't make it, I was better off dead anyway."

"What was your experience as a walker?" asks the monk.

"It wasn't what I expected," I reply.  "It was quiet and peaceful at first.  I had gotten 
away from the riders, and I was happy to be alone.  I wondered why anyone would want 
to live any other way."

"But the desert had nearly killed you before under similar circumstances-- when the 
riders had first found you, when you couldn't breathe!"

"Yes, but I was different this time," I explain to my questioner.  "The desert was the 
same; I could feel its oppressive emptiness about me.  But my experience with the riders, 
and my rejection of their ways, had somehow changed me.  I was able to conserve my 
energies in some way-- to wrap up inside of myself and survive in a void that would keep 
anything I gave to it.  I knew that if I gave of myself to that void I would die."

"But surely you would die eventually,  no matter how self-contained you were," the 
monk wonders.  "Eventually the human body needs food, drink and air."

"Perhaps, but very little... believe me..." I smile.  "At any rate... I truly believed I could 
live alone in the desert forever-- and I wanted to.

"I saw walkers occasionally, but walkers are solitary people and we did not truly 
interact.  I simply walked right by each I met at my normal pace, sharing only a glance in 
which we each understood the other's lot in life."

"How interesting," comments the monk.  "Your story is not really a new one, young 
man, yet each tale brings new lessons.  And how did your tale end here?" he inquires.  
"You are not wandering about the desert forever, as you had wished."

I sigh.  "I still wonder if that is possible.  There one is free.  But events transpired that 
made walking undesirable.  I guess that's why I came to the temple.

"When I first met the Shadow," I explain, "I still wanted to live forever in the bare 
desert.

"My dreams upon my walk had always been of the past, always the same, going 
through the stages of my life as a rider.  One night, I went back to the beginning; back to 
what was then my earliest memory--  that time I had lain dying on the doorstep of the 
desert, where the riders were to find me.

"I dreamed I lay again on that sand, and I could feel myself being sucked into a dark 
shapeless void.  But this time, instead of crying out for help, I stared into that void.  And 
as I stared, it took shape.

"It coalesced over my head into a shadowy human form.  It hovered above me, silent 
and waiting.  I knew it was waiting for me to die, but I would not surrender without 
questioning my fate.  I stood up, and I found that I was on the brink of a yawning chasm.  
Bottomless waters beckoned far below.  I wondered what they concealed."

The monk listens uneasily to the story of the Shadow, a story I've lived through many 
times.  I tell him how I refused to leap into the unknown, and how I fought for my soul.

"What happened after you threw the Shadow off the cliff?" asks the monk.

"I woke up, thankful to be alive.  But the desert seemed to have changed.

"No longer was it a quiet, empty and harmless refuge for a solitary soul.  It was 
violent, as if it were trying to get rid of me.  Stinging winds blew sand in my eyes, nose 
and mouth.  A hot red sun seared me.  My thirst became nearly unbearable.

"But I was too stubborn to give up.  Day after day, I refused to accept the Shadow's 
offer of release-- an offer that was extended every time I closed my eyes.

"Finally I reached your temple," I conclude.  "I have been battered but here I stand.  
I'm ready to face my fate, whatever it should be."  I am startled at how true my words 
seem.

The monk is silent for a long time.  He then speaks quite deliberately.

"You have faced the fires of the world, young man, and I thank the Lord that you have 
succeeded.  I wish that every vessel of God's unending spirit had such fortitude.

"You may become a monk.  I believe that your character will compel you to accept 
this challenge.  So it was with me."

"What is the challenge?" I ask.

"The challenge is to bow before God.  To accept the constraints of morality.  Few are 
willing to do so."

"How many?"

"How many monks are there?" he rephrases my query.  "All too few.  How many of 
those you have seen could face what you have faced?  And having faced such challenges, 
having survived through sheer strength of will-- how many would then have the humility 
to serve God?"

Not many, I think.  "But am I a moral man?  Am I worthy to face God?"  And I am 
asking myself as well as the monk.

He replies first.  "No one is worthy to face God, Nathan.  All have wronged him by 
leaving their rightful place at his side.  But his love is such that he will take you back.  
For you have rejected the lie that binds man to the desert."

"What is the lie?" I ask.

"To lie is to deny the truth," explains the monk.  "The desert-dwellers deny that life in 
the desert is an invalid existence.  They deny their misery.

"The riders deny their misery by hiding from the desert's true nature-- its barrenness.  
They greedily collect the desert's few resources, creating a material veil that shields their 
eyes from the desert's spiritual poverty.  Their petty hoarding occupies their awareness to 
such extent that they cannot see the holes in their hearts-- the spaces where God should 
be.

"And without God's mercy to guide them, they are unable to feel for the unfortunates, 
the walkers.  They deny the reality of the walkers' predicament by somehow convincing 
themselves that the walkers deserve their suffering.  They choose to deny that the walkers 
suffer unfairly."

"I was unable to deny it," I say.

"Your compassion forced you to face that truth.  So you joined the walkers to see if 
their condition was truly unacceptable."

"Eventually I found it to be so," I say.  "The Shadow made me see it that way."

"But most walkers accept their fate.  They dwell in the very midst of the barren desert, 
and they accept that existence with every breath they take."

"What choice do they have, though?" I wonder.  "What else can they do with 
themselves, as poor as they are?"

"They can do as you have," answers the monk.  "They can open their eyes to their true 
alternatives."

"But all I have done is search for the truth," I return.  "I found the temple by accident."

"You found the temple because you sought the truth," the monk says.  "Seeking truth, 
one finds it.  It sounds simple and it is-- but it requires great courage.   Most walkers 
prefer to hunger in the desert."

"How do they justify such an existence?"

"As the riders lie to themselves, so do the walkers," explains the monk.  "Pride is the 
lie they use to justify their situation.  In false pride, they tell themselves they are too 
strong to give up on life in the desert, however hard the life may be.

"In truth, they are afraid to face the light of God-- the light in which all truths are 
revealed.  This fear is what keeps them in the desert; the false pride makes it easier for 
them to live with the choice."

"I think I see," I reply, nodding.  "The walkers and the riders all have ways of 
rationalizing their existence in the desert.  They all have ways of denying that they are 
doing the wrong thing."

"Yes," the monk agrees, smiling at the logic.  "For one needs to believe he is doing 
right, even in the most shameful activities."

"And do you think I have rejected these shameful activities?" I ask.  "These ways of 
the desert-dwellers?"

"Yes.  You have seen their futility, and that is why you are here."

"Having rejected the desert, then, what am I left with?" I demand.  "Fear?"

The monk stares into my eyes.  "I see the fear that still threatens to consume you, 
Nathan.  You are afraid that the truth may not be to your liking.  And if so, you will be 
left with nothing..."

"Not even hope," I agree.   "But I've lied enough in this life, and now I will see the 
truth.

"Why do we walk to the desert?" I ask.  "You have shown me the lies that bind us to 
this place; now I must know why we are here.  Has man chosen to come here, or has he 
been forced to do so?"

The monk's reply is pained.  "Man chooses to come here.  God grants him the power 
to think and choose, for how else may man serve God?"  He suddenly, strangely laughs.  
"If God had to think for man, he might as well dispense with man and do everything 
himself.  But I digress...

"You ask me why man comes to the desert.  He does so because he hopes to avoid the 
alternative."

"Which is?"

"It is as I told you earlier," answers the monk.  "The alternative is to bow before God; 
to accept the constraints of morality." 

"But what does that mean?" I pursue.

"It is simply to serve God's will," he smiles.

"What is God's will?" I continue demandingly.

"That is a difficult question," the monk replies.  "We have some clear laws, as God 
has been kind enough to share the most important precepts directly with our prophets.  
But the laws do not make all decisions clear to the common man.  The rest depends on 
prayer... allowing God's will to enter one's heart...

"God's will is what directs his work-- and that work is important, that work is holy, for 
God is not subject to the petty yearnings of mankind.

"God created man to be an instrument of his will," continues the monk.  "Man helps 
God in his work by performing the role he is meant to-- the role he should seek to know.  
Knowing this role, man can use his mind to decide how to fulfill his obligation.

"This mind that God gives us is a wonderful tool; with it a man can fully realize his 
purpose, performing the details of God's work.  Unfortunately, the power to think is 
abused.  It is abused when man questions his God-given role.  You see," the monk 
explains, "man's greatest flaw is his desire to change or expand upon his role.  He 
believes that his power to think gives him the ability to make all decisions."

"I think I understand," I venture.  "Man wants to feel that he can do whatever he 
wants-- that he is capable of judging what his role should be.  He wants this power.  
When he sees that he is not granted such power by God..."

"He leaves the light," the monk finishes for me.  "He leaves his proper place in God's 
universe, because he wants greater freedom.  He seeks a world where he can rule with his 
will alone... a world where he can do whatever he wants.  

"He finds the desert.  A world he can rule-- but a barren one, outside of the light, 
unable to truly make him happy.  Yet still able to keep a hold on him, even after he sees 
he will never be happy in such darkness.   He fears the light... He fears even to see his 
rightful place, which he has forsaken.  He fears judgement for his misdeeds."

"Is this last fear a valid one?" I ask.  "Does man suffer a punishment when he faces 
God, whom he fled?"

The monk sighs sadly.  "No, of course not; God would never punish man for any deed.  
One only punishes that which he hates, and God hates no man, for God understands man 
and all his actions.

"Man punishes himself for leaving the light.  He punishes himself because he does not 
understand his own actions, which often seem wicked to him.  But when a man is ready 
to accept what he has done, when he is ready to look at himself with open eyes--  then he 
is ready to stop punishing himself.  Then he is ready for the light.  And, as I have said, 
God will take him back.

"Are you ready to face yourself, Nathan?" the monk says, ominously emphasizing my 
name.  "You have recounted your deeds, it is true, but the final task remains-- you must 
see where you have failed and accept that failure.  For only then will you believe that you 
deserve a better life.  Only then may you leave the barren desert-- the barren yet safe and 
secure desert."

"The desert certainly is safe," I agree.  "It's safe enough for anyone who really wants to 
stay in it."  I remember how close I'd often come to dying in the desert, only to live 
because of my desire to remain there.  I thought I had been strong in surviving, but had I 
only been afraid?   Afraid of the unknown?

I've been running from the Shadow for a long time.  Ever since it showed me that 
shapeless sea of risk, the unknown.  And I've been telling myself that I'm running because 
I don't want to die.

But maybe I do want to die.  Maybe I'm just afraid to actually try it.

Maybe I'm afraid to look into the sea, and see the true face below its shapeless 
surface-- a face I've known, but have hidden beneath a lie.  And is that face behind the 
lie, the face of God?

I suddenly realize, with chilling certainty, the ultimate nature of the monk's religion.  
But I ask the questions anyway.

"How may I serve God's will?" I ask.

"First you must return to the light."

"And where will I find the light?" I continue.

"Not in this desert."

"Then why do you remain here?"

"To help others see the way to the light.  Then we may leave."  The monk stares at me 
with eager religious fervor.  "Do you see the way to the light?"

And I see that he is hungry for the light.  If I become a monk, he can kill himself and 
join with his God.  I now understand the lure of his religion--  hope.  An explanation for 
this barren world, and the promise of a better one to come.

And is it the world for me?   As I wonder, I realize that I now know what my options 
are-- all of them.  I can see them in my mind.

I picture myself walking through the desert, living forever, never changing.  And the 
desert never changes; it's always the same.

I picture myself becoming a monk, showing some lost soul the way to the light, and 
killing myself.  I picture myself going to the monk's heaven, bowing to the will of God, 
playing my little part and living happily ever after.  Never changing.  And my role never 
changes.

It's always the same.

Finally I picture myself with the Shadow, looking into the sea of the unknown.  Do I 
see the face of God in that sea?   Do I see the monk's world?

No.  All I see is a shapeless sea of possibilities.  All the possibilities that arise when 
one changes-- when one leaves the comfort of the known.

And I know the face of God...

Finally, I remember the truth-- the whole truth.  Finally, I see what I have done.

*...He dips his blade in his lifeblood divine*

*And with magic force encloses a line*

*The circle thus drawn defends his spine*

*But in it his eyes shall no longer shine*

*He feeds on feces, self-deceit his crown*

*Outside of the laughing lights of the town...*

When I had first viewed the world of man, from the realm of God, I was shocked to 
think that I must go there.  But I was part of the light and I could not hide from the truth:

I needed to change.

To grow.

I had to do so on my own.  No strings attached.  So I entered the world of man-- not 
merely to understand it, as I have told the monk, but to be fundamentally altered by the 
experience.  And, as I have told the monk, I did not enter a desert.  I knew where I was 
going, and it was anything but a desert.

But once I was in the jungle, I could remember none of this.  I had to survive without 
the benefit of prior knowledge; I had to find a new place for myself in a new world-- a 
world where the light flourished, but in colors I'd never seen... the Unknown.

And, as I had known would happen, I became afraid.  I feared I would become lost in 
the new colors, for they wished me to mingle!  I feared I would lose everything I knew; I 
feared I would die.  So I ran to the desert.  I hid in its circle of nothingness.

The desert was a wonderful refuge.  I was safe there, and I still am.  I'm safe from the 
dangers that arise when one leaves the comfort of the white light and enters the 
multihues.  But I've grown as much as I can in this desert, and that is why it torments me 
with cruel winds and heat.  That is why the Shadow beckons me.

I am sad as I talk to the monk-- sad yet exulted.  So it feels to be alive.  It's the first 
time I've felt that way for ages.

"You know much of the truth, brother.  If only you were willing to know more," I 
lament.

"What do you mean?" The monk is shocked.

"You've created your own lie," I say.  "You've seen through the lies of others, and 
sensed God who is so far from this desert.  But you're unwilling to accept the whole truth, 
and so you've distorted God's message to your liking.

"You tell me of the world of God," I continue.  "You describe a way of living in the 
light-- living in harmony with God's will; playing a part in his master plan.  You say this 
is the way we should live.

"I've been to that world, monk.  I remember the light and I crave it.  But I will not fall 
for your lie.   I've fallen for too many lies.

"I know that I had to leave the light.  I know this was necessary."

The monk's expression changes from surprise to horror.  "You don't know what you're 
saying!" he proclaims.  "If you truly knew of the light, you would see that you belong 
with it!"

"I understand why you're upset," I say.  "You need to feel that your beliefs are true, so 
you cling to the known and comfortable world.  You need to believe you are right.  But to 
me, there is no more right or wrong.  There's only living and dying.  And I'm finally ready 
to live.

"Everyone needs to turn away from the light," I proclaim.  "Only then can one learn to 
shine alone.  And only then can one face one's true fate.  Goodbye, my friend."

The monk and the temple fade from my view as I seek to find my true place in the 
universe.  I find myself in the desert again.  Was the temple real?

Yes, I decide.  Everything is real.

As I walk up a long, sandy hill, the stinging gusts and the red sun seem to relax.  The 
sand beneath my feet gives way to solid rock, and I come to the edge of a barren cliff 
overlooking bottomless waters.  The Shadow floats above me.  It knows what I have been 
thinking.

"You have finally seen the way," it croons, almost reverently.

I peer into the sea below and wonder what it conceals.

"'Tis the unknown that calls to you, Abel.  The desert lies behind; you have seen its 
perils," whispers the Shadow.

"That world can trap a man," I agree.  "But it served its purpose.  What promise does 
this sea offer?"

"The unknown is the end of all want.  Those with the courage to face it no longer 
suffer the hungers you do, Abel.  Do you not yearn to cast off the shackles of this barren 
life and feast on the riches of the beyond?"

I stare into the waters to see my fate.  At first I see nothing.

Then, called from beyond by my desire to know, my eyes rise above the surface of the 
water.  Across the bay I see the distant jungle.

The jungle... It teems with life... Terribly dangerous in its clashing of ideas and forms, 
terribly beautiful in its promise of new ideas and new forms, new worlds and new life-- 
all created of God, but each free to create in turn.

I see the jungle, and I fear it still.  I know I've been prepared, but I still fear losing 
myself.  The jungle will change me.  It will carve me up and reshape me, over and over.  
And the jungle will change.  It will never be the same.

I look at the Shadow, and say words one more time.

"Can I die in that jungle?  Can I lose what I have?"

"One cannot die if one does not live," the Shadow answers, as I think of never 
changing.

I jump.

Images of the desert world flash through my mind for the last time as I splash into the 
rich waters of the sea.  God is very near as I swim towards the jungle.  If I stop 
swimming, I may stay with It.

But I am no longer a sheep at the side of God, nor a blind man in a desert.  I am a man 
who sees, and I see where I belong.

I enter the jungle.

*The sad men in their circles,*

*They don't know where they should be...*

*We're waiting for them to jump out of their skins*

*So we can all learn to be free.*
